sudo chown -R username:username /mnt/sataSSD     -(Set correct ownership and permissions and in my case my ssd mount name is sataSSD and Use lsblk to see which name you have given for your SSD or Your Harddrive)


sudo chmod -R 755 /mnt/sataSSD                   -(Make it readable/writeable by you)


ln -s /mnt/sataSSD ~/sataSSD                     -(Create a symlink into your home folder {cleanest way}  And Now it shows as ~/sataSSD â€” easily browsable in Dolphin or other file mgr you are using)


At Lasst this is optional process Add a mount point to Dolphin's sidebar
